\section{Physical interface}
The Auger \ac{RD} module is connected to the \ac{UUB} with a 25-pin D-sub connector.
On the \ac{UUB} side this connects to a 24-pin JST B24B, or SAMTEC STMM-112-01-S-D connector.
The interface pins contain 8 differential (LVDS) pairs for data and multiple power (+24V) and ground points.
Half of the 8 data signals carry the radio data traces and the other 4 are dedicated to the housekeeping interface:%

\subsection{Status LEDs}
The LEDs are permanently on as soon as the RD is successfully booted.

\begin{warning}
  This behaviour is planned to change in the future.
  Each channel has an LNA which is powered by a constant current driver that is inside the RD module.
  The voltages of the two LNA constant-current drivers are polled every 5 seconds and the corresponding LEDs are updated accordingly.
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    LED & description \\\hline
    constant off & RD not powered or not booted \\
    constant on  & RD powered up and LNA voltage inside expected range \\

\end{warning}



\section{Software interface}
The Auger \ac{RD} module has two separate interfaces.
One fast interface to capture radio traces, and one slower \ac{SPI} interface for housekeeping and metadata. 

\subsection{Radio data}
The Auger \ac{RD} module samples 12-bit data from 2 channels at 250 Msamples/s into a circular buffer.
It does so continuously until it sees a rising edge on the trigger input.
When the trigger is received the \ac{RD} will continue to write a configurable number of post-trigger samples to the buffer.
The number of post-trigger samples can be configured using the housekeeping \ac{SPI} interface and defaults to 1024 at power-up.
The total buffer always contains 2048 samples and therefore the number of pre-trigger samples equals $2048-\text{\#(pre-trigger samples)}$.
See Section \ref{sec:trigger_offset} for details. 

When the post-trigger samples have been recorded, the transfer is automatically initiated.
Figures~\ref{fig:datatransferstart}~and~\ref{fig:datatransferfinish} show the data transfer protocol. 
The transfer is clocked from the RD at 60 MHz. The clock is held high outside the transmission windows.
\begin{warning}
  The 60 MHz speed is subject to change.
  Due to the distribution of events, it is suspected that a small reduction  in transfer time could benefit the number of recorded events greatly.
\end{warning}
The transmission starts with a preamble consisting of 3 rising clock edges.
After the preamble, the 2048 samples are transmitted. Data for the 2 channels is separately transmitted on the 2 data lines.
Each sample is shifted out, most significant bit first, followed by a parity bit (odd parity). Finally, 11 trailing clock cycles are transmitted.

    \captionof{figure}{End of data transfer has 11 trailing rising edges.}\label{fig:datatransferfinish}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

There is negligeable delay between the registration of the last sample and the start of the transmission and between the end of the transmission and the registration of the first sample for the next trace.

During the transmission and during the recording of the pre-trigger samples the value of the trigger input is ignored.



\subsection{Jitter and latency}\label{sec:latency}
Data is transferred from an \ac{ADC} (ADS4229) to an \ac{FPGA} (Lattice ECP5 LFE5U-12F) over 12 LVDS pairs. The data transfer is \ac{DDR} which means that the even bits are transferred on the rising edges of the 250 MHz clock and the odd bits on the falling edges. In the \ac{FPGA} the \ac{DDR} data is decoded and further processed at 125 MHz. I.e., samples are processed 4 at a time (2 samples each from 2 channels). This means that triggers are also registered at the 125 MHz clock and that the RD inherently incurs an extra 1 sample jitter on the location of the trigger.
\begin{warning}
  This is subject to change. The next software update is scheduled to eliminate one bin of jitter.
\end{warning}


Using the trigger-offset feature of the \ac{SPI} housekeeping interface, the location of the data window relative to the trigger can be configured. By default the location is set to 1024. I.e. the center of the window. However, the trigger signal is synchronized to the 125 MHz clock domain using two registers. This results in 2 clock cycles delay (i.e. 4 samples).

The \ac{ADC} is also subject to 16 clock cycles latency (at 250 MHz). With the default trigger offset of 1024, all factors included, there are therefore 1036 or 1037 samples before the trigger and 1011 or 1012 samples after the trigger.

\end{center}

\subsection{\acs{SPI} housekeeping interface}

\subsubsection{General Architecture}
The \ac{SPI} interface exposes several features including: firmware updates, science \ac{ADC} re-configuration, \ac{GPIO} access, a temperature sensors, and readout of \ac{LNA}/bias status.
The latter provides operating voltages and currents independently on each channel.

All of the above features are handled by independent sub-systems that  are internally bridged by an \ac{SPI} demuxer. The first 8 bits of every \ac{SPI} transaction are captured by the demuxer. The remainder of the transaction is forwarded transparently to the sub-system in question.

An example program \texttt{rd\_housekeeping} is provided that exposes most of the available features. Refer to the source in the git repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/auger-prime-sde/rd/tree/master/uub-linux-tools/rd_housekeeping}}.

    \ldots                & \\
  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \captionof{figure}{\ac{SPI} demuxer example.}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{\acs{SPI} mode and speed}
The \ac{SPI} interface was tested upto 12 MHz. It is known that all sub-systems can also reach that speed.
The external interface operates with CPOL=1 and CPHA=1 (spi mode 3) at all times. The ADS4229 science adc operates in mode 2 but the responsible sub-system block handles the translation. All \ac{SPI} data is transferred \ac{MSB} first. 


\subsubsection{\ac{GPIO} (address 0x01)}
Eight \ac{GPIO} pins are available on the \ac{RD} board. All pins are configured as outputs. The \ac{GPIO} sub-system allows writing to and reading from the output buffer. The \ac{GPIO} cannot be configured as input pins. Each transaction exists of a command byte, optionally followed by a data byte in case of a write command.

The supported commands are:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    command & code & expects data \\
    \hline
    read & 0x00 & no \\
    write & 0x01 & yes \\
    set bits (gpio = gpio | data) & 0x02 & yes \\
    clear bits (gpio = gpio \& $\neg{}$ data) & 0x03 & yes \\
    reset to default (0xFF) & 0x04 & no \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \captionof{figure}{Example \ac{GPIO} read and write. The output register contains the data 0x42 and is written to 0x00.}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Program flash pass-through (address 0x02)}
Transactions to address 0x02 are forwarded transparently to the \ac{SPI} flash chip.
This flash chip uses a standard JEDEC interface.
Refer to the SST26VF032B documentation for details.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikztimingtable}[timing/wscale=0.6]
    clk      & HHCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHH \\
    uub ce   & HHLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLHH \\
    flash ce & HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLHH \\
    mosi     & UUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD{0x02 (select \ac{SPI} flash)}DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD{0x9F (read id)}UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU \\
    miso     & UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD{0xBF}DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD{0x26}DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD{0x42}UU\\
  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \captionof{figure}{Example SST26VF032B JEDEC-ID readout.}
\end{center}

The flash chip contains the FPGA user code that is loaded upon power-on.
A Primary and a Golden Pattern are present. If the checksum of the Primary Pattern fails the address in the JUMP command section is used to locate the Golden Pattern.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    Start & End & Contents & Description\\\hline
    0x000000 & 0x0AFFFF & Primary Pattern & Contains the user-code for the FPGA\\
    0x0B0000 & 0x15FFFF & Golden Pattern & Fallback code for the FPGA\\
    0x160000 & 0x3FFEFF & Calibration file & Ascii encoded calibraton data\\
    0x3FFF00 & 0x2FFFFF & JUMP command & Start address of the Golden Pattern\\
  \end{tabular}
  \captionof{table}{Flash layout.}
\end{center}

If the Primary Pattern does not pass a checksum validation (e.g. after an interrupted write) the Golden Pattern is loaded instead. The Golden Pattern implements a version of the firmware that contains nothing else except SPI access to the program flash such that the incomplete image may be restored.
Refer to the Lattice Dual Boot and Multiple Boot Features Techical Note (TN1216) for details about the dual boot procedure\footnote{\url{https://www.latticesemi.com/-/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/AD/DualandMulitpleBootFeature.ashx}}.

Neither the JUMP command not the Golden Pattern should be overwritten.
An example program \texttt{rd\_flash} is provided which performs safe read and write methods to dump and write the Primary Pattern from a bit-file.
Refer to the source in the git repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/auger-prime-sde/rd/tree/master/uub-linux-tools/rd_flash}}.

The provided \texttt{rd\_flash} tool will prohibit writes over the golden images, the jump command, or the calibration file. Note that the SPI flash interface itself provides no such protection. It is possible to brick the RD module if the sectors are erased.

\begin{warning}
  The first 6 RD module deployed in November 2019 are not equiped with a Golden Pattern or calibration section.
\end{warning}



\subsubsection{Science ADC configuration SPI pass-through (address 0x03)}
The science \ac{ADC} has a \ac{SPI} configuration interface. The ADS4229 expects \ac{SPI} mode 2 (cpol=1, cpha=0) but also works in \ac{SPI} mode 1 (cpol=0, cpha=1) which is achieved by inverting the clock signal from the \ac{UUB} interface.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikztimingtable}[timing/wscale=1]

  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \captionof{figure}{Example ADS4229 transaction. This sets the channel A gain (config register address 0x25) to 2dB.}
\end{center}

Refer to the ADS4229 datasheet \footnote{\url{http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads4229.pdf}} for details on the available registers in the configuration interface.


\subsubsection{ADS1015 current and voltage sensors (address 0x04)}
The ADS1015 is a four port \ac{I2C} \ac{ADC} which is wired to measure the voltage and the current on both \ac{LNA} channels. This can be used to determine if the \ac{LNA} is properly connected and working as expected.

\begin{warning}
    This behaviour is not yet implemented in firmware version 3. In this version a conversion is triggered after the sample buffer write cycle is completed. 
\end{warning}

Periodically (every 5 seconds) the internal controller for this \ac{I2C} chip will execute a fixed sequence of \ac{I2C} commands and store the conversion result in a register. The register can be read via \ac{SPI} and contains eight bytes:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Register address & contents \\
    \hline
    0x00 & bits [11:4] of \acs{ADC} channel 0 (N/S bias current)\\
    0x01 & bits [3:0]  of \acs{ADC} channel 0, followed by four zeroes\\
    0x02 & bits [11:4] of \acs{ADC} channel 1 (N/S bias voltage)\\
    0x03 & bits [3:0]  of \acs{ADC} channel 1, followed by four zeroes \\
    0x04 & bits [11:4] of \acs{ADC} channel 2 (E/W bias current)\\
    0x05 & bits [3:0]  of \acs{ADC} channel 2, followed by four zeroes \\
    0x06 & bits [11:4] of \acs{ADC} channel 3 (E/W bias voltage)\\
    0x07 & bits [3:0]  of \acs{ADC} channel 3, followed by four zeroes \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionof{table}{ADS1015 register layout}
\end{center}

The ADS1015 has a \ac{PGA}. All conversions are made with the $FSR=\pm4.096 V$ setting. I.e. $MSB = 2 mV$.

To read a byte from the register, write the address of that register and read the data on the next byte. The next address can already be written during the read and therefore the whole register can efficiently be retrieved in a 10-byte transaction (including the sub-system address byte). 
If the readout overlaps with a new measurement the readout is guaranteed to return consistent sample values.


\begin{center}
  \begin{tikztimingtable}[timing/wscale=0.8]

  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \captionof{figure}{Example ADS1015 register readout for the E/W \ac{LNA} bias current.}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{SI7060 temperature sensor (address 0x05)}
The Si7060 is an \ac{I2C} temperature sensor which measures the temperature inside the \ac{RD} enclosure.

\begin{warning}
  This behaviour is not yet implemented in firmware version 3. In this version a conversion is triggered after the sample buffer write cycle is completed. 
\end{warning}

Periodically (every 5 seconds), the controller for this \ac{I2C} chip will execute a fixed sequence of \ac{I2C} commands and stores the conversion result in a register. The register can be read via \ac{SPI} and contains two bytes:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Register address & contents \\
    \hline
    0x00 & Dspsigm of Si7060 (one status bit and data bits [14:8])\\
    0x01 & Dspsigl of Si7060 (data bits [7:0])\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionof{table}{ADS1015 register layout.}
\end{center}



The raw 15-bit data is calculated as:
$$
D =  \text{Dspsigm}[6:0] < < 8 + \text{Dspsigl}[7:0]
$$

The temperature can be calculated as follows:
$$
T (^\circ{}C) = 55 + (D - 16384) / 160
$$



To read a byte from the register simply write the address of that register and read the data on the next byte. The next address can already be written during the read and therefore the whole register can efficiently be read in one 4-bute transaction (including the sub-system address byte).
If the readout overlaps with a new measurement the readout is guaranteed to return consistent sample values.

\subsubsection{Version info (address 0x07)}
This sub-system will always return a 1-byte version code.
The currently known version codes are:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Code & Description \\
    \hline
    0x00 & legacy (version info not implemented) \\
    0x01, 0x02 & used during development \\
    0x03 & version shipped with \ac{RD} v3 units for the Malargue engineering array in November 2019\\
    0xFE & fallback image used in the golden pattern\\
    0xFF & may indicate SPI communication error on the UUB\\

\subsubsection{Trigger-offset configuration(address 0x08)}\label{sec:trigger_offset}
The position of the trigger within the data window can be configured.
This trigger-offset is set to 1024 (mid window) on power up but can be changed using this interface.
The value is set by writing two bytes to this sub-system. Only the lower 11 bits are used. The upper 5 bits are ignored.
The written number represents the position in the data trace where the trigger will be located. Note that the actual trigger appears at a slightly different position due to latency in the \ac{ADC} and in the \ac{RD}. Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:rd_timing} for details.
\begin{center}

\end{center}

Values of 0, 1, 2047 and 2048 are not permissible.
\begin{warning}
  In the next firmware update this constraint will be dropped.
\end{warning}


\subsubsection{Boot time and boot sequence}
After power is applied the \ac{FPGA} loads its configuration from the SST26VF032B \ac{SPI} flash.
As soon as the user code is running the \ac{RD} executes a hard-coded initialization sequence on the \ac{SPI} interface, as if the \ac{UUB} had sent the following commands:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \acs{SPI} commands & Description \\
    \hline
    \texttt{0x03 0x00 0x02} & ADS4229 software reset \\
    \texttt{0x03 0x29 0x00} & re-assert default configuration \\
    \texttt{0x03 0x41 0x00} & re-assert default configuration \\
    \texttt{0x03 0x03 0x03} & enable high-performance mode \\
    \texttt{0x03 0xF2 0x00} & disable low speed mode (already off by default)\\
    \texttt{0x03 0xEF 0x00} & disable low speed mode (already off by default)\\
    \texttt{0x03 0x41 0x00} & cmos mode off (already off by default)\\
    \texttt{0x03 0x02 0x40} & enable high performance mode \\
    \texttt{0x03 0xD5 0x18} & enable high performance mode \\
    \texttt{0x03 0xD7 0x0C} & enable high performance mode \\
    \texttt{0x03 0xDB 0x20} & enable high performance mode \\
    \texttt{0x08 0x04 0x00} & set trigger-offset to 1024 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionof{table}{\ac{RD} initialization sequence. }
  
\end{center}

This initialization sequences takes approximately 170 us. During this time the \ac{SPI} lines from the \ac{UUB} are inhibited and the MISO line will remain silent.

\subsection{\acs{ADC} driver}
The adc\_driver converts the 12 \ac{DDR} 250 MHz data lines to 48 `normal' data lines at 125MHz.
At each clock cycle 2 samples are produced for each of the 2 channels.
In the ADS4229 datasheet we find that the bits of the samples are organized slightly differently than the output of the auto-generated adc\_driver block produces them:

  \captionof{figure}{Adc\_driver output format. Q is the data format of the adc\_driver output. S is the data format of the ADC. Note that for historical compatibility channel A on the ADC is channel 2 of the RD and channel B on the ADC is channel 1 of the RD. The four samples that are processed by the RD simultaneously have been color coded. The trigger signal is sampled with the ADC data but it is not actually transmitted with the samples.}
\end{center}


Note that the trigger input is used as the 13th input to the \ac{DDR} decoder.
This provides four synchonized samples of the trigger input.
The last sample (q[51]) is used to trigger the write\_controller.
The second (q[25]) is used to determine if the even or odd sample will be used as the first (and last) sample in the trace.
The sub-sample trigger information (q[12] \textbf{xor} q[25] \textbf{xor} q[36]) can be retrieved through the housekeeping \ac{SPI} interface.

\begin{warning}
  This behaviour has not yet been implemented.
  The current implementation simply forwards the external trigger to the write\_controller which samples it as 125 MHz with minimal synchonization.
\end{warning}





\subsubsection{Write Controller}
%The write controller is responsible for enabling and disabling writes to the circular buffer.
%It listens in on the address counter ($i\_curr\_address$) and controls (besides the write enable ($o\_write\_enable$)) the start ($o\_trigger\_done$) and trigger-offset ($o\_start\_addr$) of the Readout Controller.
%
%A configurable trigger-offset ($i\_start\_offset$) determines how many samples are stored before the trigger.
%In the current instantiation the address width is eleven bits so there are 2048 samples and therefore $2048 - i\_start\_offset$ samples after the trigger.
%
%
%The Write Controller needs to be enabled with a pulse on the $i\_arm$ input.
%After this pulse the Write Controller will enable writes within 2 clock cycles.
%
%The \ac{ADC} driver outputs 2 samples in each clock cycle (for each channel, so 4 in total at each clock cycle).
%Therefore the Write Controller should wait for at least
%$$
%\left\lceil\frac{i\_start\_offset}{2}\right\rceil
%$$
%clock cycles  before accepting triggers.
%
%After the trigger is first seen high, the Write Controller should keep $o\_write\_enable$ high for exactly
%$$
%\left\lceil\frac{2048 - i\_start\_offset}{2}\right\rceil
%$$
%clock cycles. At that time $o\_write\_enable$ has to be asserted low and $o\_trigger\_done$ should be asserted high. At that time $o\_start\_addr$ has to be set to the address at which the data starts:
%$$
%i\_curr\_addr - i\_start\_offset \pmod{2048}
%$$
%This condition should hold until the next pulse on the $i\_arm$ signal.
%
%
%A trigger-offset of 0 (or 1) is considered invalid but anything in the closed interval $[1, 2047]$ should work.
%



\subsubsection{Trigger injection through housekeeping \ac{SPI}}
\begin{warning}
  This \ac{SPI} sub-system is candidate for removal in the next release.
  This address 0x06 may become a trigger for the \ac{I2C} readout instead.
\end{warning}

There is an \ac{SPI} sub-system at address 0x06 that can be used to trigger the \ac{RD} if no external trigger is present.
This is useful for debugging.
The inverted CE of this submodule is or'ed with the external trigger input. It is not necessary to send any data for the trigger to work.
